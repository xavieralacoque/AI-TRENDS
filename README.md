# AI-TRENDS in HEALTHCARE
---

The progress in computer modelling and simulation applied in disease management ( and health ) constitutes a **major competitive advantage.**

### 1- Trust
Consequently, various Decision Support Systems have been developed for different medical disciplines. 

While the market continues to develop and expand by addressing the need for more precise and personalized diagnostics and treatments, the proposed software tools and platforms **often need to further increase substantially visibility and trust by users and investors** in order to have application areas in routine clinical practice. 

Medical reasoning must be done with the help of **ISO-certified tools (accuracy, efficiency, explainability).** The pitfall here stands in the way medical information is gathered (blur and missing data). Therefore algorithms and tools are built onto this weakness.

This means that critical-systems knowledged teams could help the healthcare system to leverage this issue , and to  provide such 100% trustyful tools. 

> Scientific helps from transport industry should be a major step forward in this line of thoughts.

### 2- Confidentiality concerns
Despite the urgent need for such tools, the level of clinical data sharing (mandatory for effective algorithms development) is extremely low. 

According to a recent E.U. study, the **main barriers are not information technology or legislation, but rather people's attitudes,** awareness and cooperation. Overall, the respondents agreed that storing electronic health data is beneficial for enhancing quality of the treatment, preventing health epidemics, and reducing delays, with 75.5%, 63.9%, and 58.9% respectively.

However, there were still concerns over appropriate methods taken into place to protect the data, with only 38.4% of respondents thinking that healthcare providers provide effective data security successfully. 
The survey shows that there was a higher preference of storing the data, specifically with granting access to all health professionals. Nevertheless, there is less preference to share the health data with wider audience such as fire personnel and academic researchers **even if the data is anonymized.**

### 3- Needs
The access of researchers to high quality data and in particular to clinical multidisciplinary data is crucial for validating the use of new tools and platforms in the right practice context. 

**Personalized medicine** is led by algorithms (predictors, personalized decision making, advanced diagnostic, treatment tools). 

 > Nevertheless, algorithms need to be trained onto datasets to depict reality and to be effective for each patient. The most important need here is to gain access to a large volume of Electronic Health Records (E.H.R.) and to compute them with other science datasets in the same interoperable environment (omics, fundamental research and simulations, social, environmental, exposition to perturbators or pollution, contamination, radiations, etc..).
 
Our first main objective should be to overcome barriers of sharing Health Data, because big Data (and A.I.) in Health means Big Trust. A **bottom-up approach starting from Patients** and Healthcare providers centered on a living lab should get the job done. Therefore with helps of our research community from core sciences to industry , we should be able to reach the **standard level of critical-system certified tools.**


### 4- Pitfalls
But it remains pitfalls and ascertainment in Healthcare big data and A.I. Biggest issue is the locked-in syndrome and data accessibility.
Mostly due to current methods in the domains of collecting and using data appropriately, approximately 50% of all research data and experiments is considered not reproducible, and the vast majority (likely over 80%) of data will never be stored in a trusted and sustainable repository. In terms of Europe’s investment in data-generating research of 120B€ between 2014-20243, the annual capital destruction is consequently substantial4,5,6. This does not take into consideration associated losses from inefficient data analysis and the economic impact of stalling innovation and societal non-applicability of knowledge. 
Good data stewardship and a globally operational Internet of FAIR data and services will significantly reduce these losses and fuel science and innovation. In this societal, medical, IT and business context, SHIELDS will contribute to share data and services in open cloud-based environments with the objective to stimulate the virtual complex experimentations in medicine and fortify the link between researchers, industrials, patients and healthcare practitioners, for their common benefit . 

### 5- Trends and Goal

in this era , the following notebboks in python will draw a concept note of A.I. in healthcare .
I will study scientific teams and academic research in this area , I will study medical needs with the highlight of the end-users , I will draw a general picture of trends and geopolitics in healthcare A.I. deveopments .
