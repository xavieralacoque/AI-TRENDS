# AI-TRENDS in HEALTHCARE

The progress in computer modelling and simulation applied in disease management constitutes a major competitive advantage. 
Consequently, various Decision Support Systems have been developed for different medical disciplines. 
While the market continues to develop and expand by addressing the need for more precise and personalized diagnostics and treatments, the proposed software tools and platforms often need to further increase substantially visibility and trust by users and investors in order to have application areas in routine clinical practice. 
Despite the urgent need for such tools, the level of clinical data sharing (mandatory for effective algorithms development) is extremely low. 

According to a recent E.U. study, the main barriers are not information technology or legislation, but rather people's attitudes, awareness and cooperation. Overall, the respondents agreed that storing electronic health data is beneficial for enhancing quality of the treatment, preventing health epidemics, and reducing delays, with 75.5%, 63.9%, and 58.9% respectively.
However, there were still concerns over appropriate methods taken into place to protect the data, with only 38.4% of respondents thinking that healthcare providers provide effective data security successfully. 
The survey shows that there was a higher preference of storing the data, specifically with granting access to all health professionals. Nevertheless, there is less preference to share the health data with wider audience such as fire personnel and academic researchers even if the data is anonymized. 
Moreover, the study shows that peoples’ attitudes towards data protection and privacy differ greatly across Europe. For example, patients in Estonia, Finland and Sweden are not significantly concerned about the use of their health data, while 20-40% of patients in Poland and Germany consider it an important point of concern and in the UK up to 60%.

The access of researchers to high quality big data and in particular to clinical multidisciplinary data is crucial for validating the use of new tools and platforms in the right practice context. 
Personalized medicine is led by algorithms (predictors, personalized decision making, advanced diagnostic, treatment tools). Nevertheless, algorithms need to be trained onto large datasets to depict reality and to be effective for each patient. The most important need here is to gain access to a large volume of Electronic Health Records (E.H.R.) and to compute them with other science datasets in the same interoperable environment (omics, fundamental research and simulations, social, environmental, exposition to perturbators or pollution, contamination, radiations, etc..).

But it remains pitfalls and ascertainment in Healthcare big data (Figure 1). Biggest issue is the locked-in syndrome and data accessibility.
Mostly due to current methods in the domains of collecting and using data appropriately, approximately 50% of all research data and experiments is considered not reproducible, and the vast majority (likely over 80%) of data will never be stored in a trusted and sustainable repository. In terms of Europe’s investment in data-generating research of 120B€ between 2014-20243, the annual capital destruction is
